# Deep-Learning

Tensorflow is Google's library for deep learning and artificial intelligence. Deep Learning has been responsible for some amazing achievements recently, such as:

1] Generating beautiful, photo-realistic images of people and things that never existed (GANs)

2] Beating world champions in the strategy game Go, and complex video games like CS:GO and Dota 2 (Deep Reinforcement Learning)

3] Self-driving cars (Computer Vision)

4] Speech recognition (e.g. Siri) and machine translation (Natural Language Processing)

5] Even creating videos of people doing and saying things they never did (DeepFakes - a potentially nefarious application of deep learning)
